Unit test classes should be placed in here.

The structure of the tests conforms to Atoum's notion of how unit tests
ought to be structured. However, it means the namespaces must be
lowercase, which does not follow the standard naming conventions of the
rest of this package.

For the time being, we are leaving the tests in a non-standard
namespace, but in the future we may change this.
