namespace HPCloud\Storage;

/**
 * Provides CDN services for ObjectStorage.
 *
 * CDN stands for "Content Distribution Network." It provides distributed
 * caching in the cloud. When a Container is CDN-enabled, objects will be
 * stored not @em just in the ObjectStorage, but temporary cached copies
 * will be stored on servers around the world.
 *
 * @attention
 * Caches are not protected by authentication. If you store an object in
 * a CDN, cached versions of that object are publically accessible. Setting
 * an ACL will have very little impact on this.
 *
 * CDN is an HPCloud extension service, and is not presently part of OpenStack
 * proper. The current REST API documentation can be found at
 * http://api-docs.hpcloud.com/
 *
 * <b>Usage</b>
 *
 * The CDN service functions as an <i>add-on</i> to ObjectStorage. It adds a
 * caching layer. So terms used here, such as Container and Object, refer
 * to the ObjectStorage items.
 *
 * For the most part, CDN operates on the Container level. You can choose to
 * tell the CDN about a particular Container in ObjectStorage, and it will
 * cache items in that container.
 *
 * The CDN service keeps a list of ObjectStorage Containers that it knows
 * about. CDN does not automatically discover ObjectStorage Containers; you
 * must tell CDN about the ObjectStorage instances you want it to know
 * about. This is done using CDN::enable().
 *
 * Once the CDN service knows about an ObjectStorage Container, it will
 * begin caching objects in that container.
 *
 * This library gives the the ability to do the following:
 *
 * - List the containers that CDN knows about: CDN::containers()
 * - Retrieve the CDN properties for a particular Container: CDN::container().
 * - Add and enable containers: CDN::enable().
 * - Enable or Disable containers: CDN::enable() and CDN::disable().
 * - Remove a Container from CDN: CDN::delete().
 * - Modify the caching properties of a Container: CDN::update().
 *
 * <b>Example</b>
 *
 * @code
 * <?php
 * // Authentication info:
 * $endpoint = 'https://auth.example.com';
 * $username = 'butcher@hp.com';
 * $password = 'secret';
 * $tenantId = '123456789';
 *
 * // First we need to authenticate:
 * $identity = new \HPCloud\Services\IdentityServices($endpoint);
 * $token = $identity->authenticateAsUser($username, $password, $tenantId);
 *
 * // Get the service catalog. We will try to have CDN build itself from
 * // the service catalog.
 * $catalog = $identity->serviceCatalog();
 *
 * // Get a new CDN instance:
 * $cdn = CDN::newFromServiceCatalog($catalog, $token);
 *
 * // Add a container to CDN; set cache lifetime to an hour:
 * $cdn->enable('myContainer', 3600);
 *
 * // Get a list of all containers that CDN knows about,
 * // and print cache lifetime for each:
 * foreach ($cdn->containers() as $container) {
 *   print $container['name'] . ':' . $container['ttl'] . PHP_EOL;
 * }
 *
 * // Change the cache lifetime on our container
 * $cdn->update('myContainer', array('ttl' => 7200));
 *
 * // Temporarily stop the container from caching:
 * $cdn->disable('myContainer');
 *
 * //This can be re-enabled again:
 * $cdn->enable('myContainer');
 *
 * // If we no longer want this Container in CDN, we
 * // should delete it, not just disable it:
 * $cdn->delete('myContainer');
 *
 * ?>
